Once upon a time, there was a man named Jeff. He could not read or write,
but he was in possession of a very special device that allowed him
to overcome his problem. It was, in fact, a literate jar of guacamole.
Whenever he needed to read something, he would show the literate guacamole
the words, and it would read them aloud to him. Whenever he needed to
write something, he poured some literate guacamole on his hand, and it 
allowed him to trace out the letters of the words he wanted to write.

One day, the king hold a poem competition. 
Jeff attended the competition, and with the help of guacamole, he won the first prize.
Everybody was moved by his poem. Everyone read his poem became peaceful. 
They hugged each other. The quarrel stopped. The war ended. 
The king was happy and decied to let Jeff marry to the princess. 
However, the princess is allergic to the guacamole.

Jeff was conflicted. The guacamole had brought him far past where his own
capabilities would have taken him. He would be nowhere without it! However the
princess was beautiful, caring, and rich. But she only loved him due to his beautiful
writing. He narrowed it down to one option: hide the guacamole and only use it 
when alone. So he kept it a secret. A deadly secret.

They got married. But soon enough, the princess started becoming suspicious of Jeff's
behaviour. Everytime Jeff had to read or write someting, he would lock himself in the
bathroom. One day, the princess decided to search Jeff's bag while he was asleep. 
She had figured out Jeff's secret.

But, since he was still a decent guy, she loved him anyway and they lived happily
ever after.

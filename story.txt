Once upon a time, there was a man named Jeff. He could not read or write,
but he was in possession of a very special device that allowed him
to overcome his problem. It was, in fact, a literate jar of guacamole.
Whenever he needed to read something, he would show the literate guacamole
the words, and it would read them aloud to him. Whenever he needed to
write something, he poured some literate guacamole on his hand, and it 
allowed him to trace out the letters of the words he wanted to write.

One day, the king hold a poem competition. 
Jeff attended the competition, and with the help of guacamole, he won the first prize.
Everybody was moved by his poem. Everyone read his poem became peaceful. 
They hugged each other. The quarrel stopped. The war ended. 
The king was happy and decied to let Jeff marry to the princess. 
However, the princess is allergic to the guacamole.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Jeff. He could not read or write,
but he was in possession of a very special device that allowed him
to overcome his problem. It was, in fact, a literate jar of guacamole.
Whenever he needed to read something, he would show the literate guacamole
the words, and it would read them aloud to him. Whenever he needed to
write something, he poured some literate guacamole on his hand, and it 
allowed him to trace out the letters of the words he wanted to write.
